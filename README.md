We are given data used in a study of the homicide rate (HOM) in Detroit, over the years 1961-1973. The following data were collected by J.C. Fisher, and used in his paper ”Homicide in Detroit: The Role of Firearms,” Criminology, vol. 14, pp. 387-400, 1976. Each row is for a year, and each column are values of a variable. 

FTP - Full-time police per 100,000 population
UEMP - % unemployed in the population
MAN - number of manufacturing workers in thousands
LIC - Number of handgun licenses per 100,000 population
GR - Number of handgun registrations per 100,000 population
NMAN - Number of non-manufacturing workers in thousands
GOV - Number of government workers in thousands
HE - Average hourly earnings
WE - Average weekly earnings
HOM - Number of homicides per 100,000 population

It turns out that three of the variables together are good predictors of the homicide rate: FTP, WE, and one more variable.
I devised a mathematical formulation to determine the third variable, then conducted experiments to find it.
